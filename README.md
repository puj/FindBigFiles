# FindBigFiles
A small UWP app to find largest files, given a directory


# Current
* User is presented with a picker  
* ListView updates with the largest (descending) files as the program recurses  
* Human-readable format for file size (rounded)  

# TODO
* Show more files
* Add threshold (i.e. > 1g)  
* Add ability to show directories  
* Show directories that sum up to over the threshold (but as deep as possible)
